#Day28 of #100DaysOfCode


## Project 28 - Flash Card GUI
This application helps the user learn the common words in spanish language. The words are randomized
If the user knows the word and meaning, they should click on the check mark image and the word won't show again
else they should click on the cross image to keep showing the word. Flip the card to know the meaning in English.

### PS: The words are not removed from the list entirely, only removed for the current time the application is running.
